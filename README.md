# A Wikipedia Page for myself

* It contains headings (h1), subheadings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3) etc. Sections within the HTML5 < section > tag are added.
* The sections are collapsible, i.e., when you click the heading, everything under the heading in that section collapses, and when you click the heading again, it expands.
* The page auto-magically generates a Table of Contents.
